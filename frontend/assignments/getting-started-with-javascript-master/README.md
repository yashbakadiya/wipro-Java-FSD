## Practice

### Write JavaScript Programs

#### Context

JavaScript provides lot of flexibility while writing programs. 

As a developer, it is very much important to have a good hold over basic programming syntax before writing complex codes.

The challenge comprises of various problem statements.

The problems involve working with variable declarations, function definitions, working with conditional statements and string manipulations

Developing solutions for these problems, will give a good hold over JavaScript syntax


#### Problem Statements

1. Compute net payable amount for the items purchased based on the inputs provided for price, quantity and discount applicable.
2. Draw pyramid pattern
3. Generate random whole numbers in a given range
4. Validate Phone Number using Regex
5. Validate Password for the given criteria
6. Check the eligibility to vote for the age value provided.
7. Replace old string with new string in a given string.

#### Instructions

1. Download and unzip the boilerplate code.  
2. Run the command `npm install` to install the dependencies required for automated testing.  
3. Open the boilerplate code in VSCode to develop the assignment solution.
4. Provide the solution code inside the respective `.js` file for each problem.
5. Each function should return the resultant which can then be tested through automated test cases.
6. First, test the solution locally by running the command `npm run test`.  
7. Refactor the solution to ensure all test cases are passing.  
8. DO NOT MODIFY THE PROVIDED CODE, ELSE THIS MAY IMPACT THE TEST CODE EXECUTION.

## Submitting your solution for preliminary automated review  

 1. Open https://codereview-wipro.stackroute.in/#/app and login into the platform  
 2. Under Assignment repository select `getting-started-with-javascript`, and branch master  
 3. Under Your solution repository select your own repository and branch  
 4. Press Submit  
 5. Evaluation will take around 2 mins to complete after which you need to refresh your browser and get the updated status    
 6. Press click here for the feedback 
 7. Watch out for your total score and detailed status on each test and eslint errors in the coloured blocks on the screen  
 8. Fix failing test cases as well as eslint errors and re-submit your solution until you get 100%
